Hi there, I'm Ridwan Panji Akbar! 👋

A backend software engineer passionate about building reliable and secure web technologies. I'm currently expanding my skill set by diving into Python and its ecosystems.

**🌱 Currently Exploring & Learning**
- **🔐 Cyber Security:** Deepening my understanding of web security, penetration testing, and the balance between Blue Team defense and Red Team offense.
- **🖥️ Infrastructure:** Getting hands-on with Linux server management, deployment, and cloud services to understand how applications live in production.
- **🐍 Python:** Actively learning Python to add another tool to my backend development toolkit.

I believe in continuous learning and I'm always open to discussing technology, sharing knowledge, and collaborating on interesting projects.
